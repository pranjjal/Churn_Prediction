This repository contains a dataset for predicting customer churn in a business setting. The dataset includes various customer attributes, such as demographics, account information, and transaction history, which are used to build machine learning models for churn prediction.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information

The dataset consists of multiple features that help identify patterns in customer churn behavior.

ðŸ”¹ Features

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Geography: Country of residence (e.g., France, Germany, Spain).

Gender: Customer's gender (Male/Female).

Age: Age of the customer.

Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the company.

Balance: Account balance of the customer.

NumOfProducts: Number of products the customer has purchased.

HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active user (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer.

Exited: Target variable (1 = Churned, 0 = Not Churned).

ðŸ”§ Preprocessing Steps

Before training machine learning models, the dataset requires preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Check and fill/remove any missing data.

Encoding Categorical Features: Convert Geography and Gender into numerical values using one-hot encoding.

Feature Scaling: Apply StandardScaler to normalize numerical features.

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Workflow

Split Data: Train-test split using train_test_split.

Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding, scaling, and transformations.

Train Models: Implement models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Evaluation: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision.
